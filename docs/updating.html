<h1>3. Updating</h1>

<section>This page describes how to update the application.</section>

<h2>3.1. General information</h2>
<section>
Updating the application can be separated into 3 parts: binary, database, environment.
<p/>

<ul>

<li>Binary includes the <code>key2gym.jar</code> file and the <code>lib</code> folder. These
files can be simply replaced by the files from the newer distribution.</li>
<p/>

<li>Database includes the schema and data used by the application. This step is
done automatically upon the first launch of the updated application. You can check
logs to see the result of an attempt to update the database's schema and data.</li>
<p/>

<li>Environment includes all the configuration files, that are located in the <code>etc</code>
folder. There are 2 options for performing this step: replacing configuration files
with the files from the newer distribution and altering them to match the needs, or
comparing the newer files with the older files to ensure that the your configuration files
match the syntax and the format of the newer configuration files.</li>
<p/>

</ul>

You also should check out the rest of this page to see version-specific steps
of updating the application.

<h2>3.2. 2.2.0 - 2.3.0</h2>
<section>
Follow general steps but pay attention to the following changes:
<ul>
<li><code>etc/log.properties</code> is renamed to <code>etc/logging.properties</code>.</li>
<li>The support of MySQL database is <b>dropped</b>. It's been replaced with PostgreSQL.
Check <a href="./configuration.html">Configuration</a> page for instructions on how
to setup the PostgreSQL server. The following command can be used to generate
compatible dump: 
<p/>

<pre><code>mysqldump --compatible=postgresql,ansi --no-create-info --skip-quote-names --default-character-set=utf8 --skip-add-locks --complete-insert database</code></pre>
<p/>

You can than execute the result SQL file on the PostgreSQL server.
<p/>

Note that <code>MySQLEclipseLink</code> is now an unsupported connection type. Use <code>PostgreSQLEclipseLink</code> instead.
</ul>
