  Go to <a href="http://openejb.apache.org/downloads.html">Apache 
    OpenEJB website</a> to obtain a distribution of OpenEJB Standalone. 
  The program has been intensively tested with OpenEJB 4.5.1, however the
  later versions should work as well. See the <a href="http://openejb.apache.org/documentation.html">OpenEJB documentation</a>
  for additional information on installing and configuring the server.
