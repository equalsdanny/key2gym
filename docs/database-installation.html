<h2>1.1. Installation</h2>

<section>
    Go to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL website</a> to obtain 
    a distribution of PostgreSQL server. The program has been intensively
    tested with PostgreSQL 9.1, however the later version should work as well. 
    If you are running Linux/Unix/BSD, we suggest you to install the PostgreSQL 
    server from the official repository. 
    See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/index.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, 
    if you need help with installing or configuring the server.

    <p/>
    The following is a typical setup of a user and a database:

    <pre><code>postgres=# CREATE USER myuser PASSWORD 'mypassword';<br/>
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase OWNER myuser;<br/>
postgres=# \c mydatabase<br/>
postgres=# ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO myuser;</code></pre>

    Note that you also need to modify <code>pg_hba.conf</code> to accept TCP/IP connections from
    the hosts, where the business tier is going to be run. For example, if the
    business tier is going to be located on the same host as the database server, 
    you need to have the following configuration file:

    <pre><code>host     mydatabase     myuser     127.0.0.1/32    password</code></pre>
