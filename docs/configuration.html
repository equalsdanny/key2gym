<h2>Connections</h2>

<section>
Connections describe how the application should connect to the storage that is to be used. 
Connections are stored as files in <code>etc/connections/</code>. A connection file's name has the following format: <code>&lt;codeName&gt;.properties.</code> A connection file itself is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">Java-style properties file</a>.

<p/>

The following is the table of supported properties:
