<h2>Connections</h2>

<section>
Connections describe how the application should connect to the storage that is to be used. 
Connections are stored as files in <code>etc/connections/</code>. A connection file's name has the following format: <code>&lt;codeName&gt;.properties.</code> A connection file itself is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">Java-style properties file</a>.

<p/>

The following is the table of supported properties:
</section>

<table>

<thead>

<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Required</td>
</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>type</td>
<td class="description">Defines the type of this connection. Built-in types of connections: <code>PostgreSQLEclipseLink</code>. Other connections can be supported by adding new classes at runtime. See <code>ConnectionsManager</code> class in the developer's documentation.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>title</td>
<td class="description">The string that is going to displayed in the application as the description of this connection. The value can by any string. Note that you have to escape the Unicode characters. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">properties format description</a> for details. </td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

<section>
All other keys are type-specific.
<p/>
<code>PostgreSQLEclipseLink</code> is the only built-in connection type as for now. It's recommended to use it with all PostgreSQL servers. The following is the table of properties specific to this connection type:
</section>

<table>

<thead>
<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Required</td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>host</td>
<td class="description">The server's host name, which usuall is a FQDN or IP address of the server. The whole range of valid values is environment-specific.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>port</td>
<td class="description">The server's port number, which can be any number in the range of 1-65535. Default port for MySQL servers is 3306.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td class="description">The PostgreSQL user. The user must have permissions to create, alter and remove tables, as well as select, update and delete rows in the target database.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>password</td>
<td class="description">The PostgreSQL user's password. The password has to be plain text.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>database</td>
<td class="description">The PostgreSQL database to use. The database must already exist. The application will automatically create the schema. If the schema's version is older than the application's version, the application will apply patches to update it without any data loss.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<section>By default, the application will show a connections chooser dialog upon
start up. If you want to always use the same connection, specify <code>connection</code> command-line argument.
For example, if you want to use connection described in <code>myconnection.properties</code>,
your command-line argument should be <code>--connection=myconnection</code>.
