<h1>1. Deployment</h1>

<section>This page explains how to deploy a distribution of Key2Gym.</section>

<h2>1.1. Java</h2>

<section>
    This program is written in Java. Therefore, it requires Java Runtime Environment
    to be available at the target computer. Go to <a href="http://java.com"> Java website</a> for instructions on
    how to install Java Runtime Environment on your target OS. All examples of launching the application
    in this documentation assume you have the <code>java</code> program on the path.

<h2>1.2. Database</h2>

<section>
    Key2Gym uses external Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store its business data.
    As for now the only supported RDBMS is PostgreSQL. The program has been intensively
    tested with PostgreSQL 9.1, however the later version should work as well. Go to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL website</a> to obtain a distribution of PostgreSQL server. If you are running
    Linux/Unix/BSD, we suggest you to install the PostgreSQL server from the official repository. 
    See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/index.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, if you need help with installing or configuring the server.

    <p/>
    The following is a typical setup of a user and a database:

    <pre><code>postgres=# CREATE USER myuser PASSWORD 'mypassword';<br/>
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase OWNER myuser;<br/>
postgres=# \c mydatabase<br/>
postgres=# ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO myuser;</code></pre>

    Note that you also need to modify <code>pg_hba.conf</code> to accept TCP/IP connections from
    the hosts, where the application is going to be used. For example, if the application
    is going to be run from the same host as the server, you need to have:

    <pre><code>host     mydatabase     myuser     127.0.0.1/32    password</code></pre>
