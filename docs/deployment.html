<h1>1. Deployment</h1>

<section>This page explains how to deploy a distribution of Key2Gym.</section>

<h2>1.1. Java</h2>

<section>
This program is written in Java. Therefore, it requires Java Runtime Environment
to be available at the target computer. Go to <a href="http://java.com"> Java website</a> for instructions on
how to install Java Runtime Environment on your target OS.
</section>

<h2>1.2. Database</h2>

<section>
Key2Gym uses external Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store its business data.
As for now the only supported RDBMS is PostgreSQL. The program has been intensively
tested with PostgreSQL 9.1, however the later version should work as well. Go to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL website</a> to obtain a distribution of PostgreSQL server. If you are running
Linux/Unix/BSD, we suggest you to install the PostgreSQL server from the official repository. 
See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/index.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, if you need help with installing or configuring the server.

<p/>
The following is a typical setup of a user and a database:
<p/>

<pre><code>postgres=# CREATE USER myuser PASSWORD 'mypassword';
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase OWNER myuser;
postgres=# \c mydatabase
postgres=# ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO myuser;</code></pre>
<p/>

Note that you also need to modify <code>pg_hba.conf</code> to accept TCP/IP connections from
the hosts, where the application is going to be used. For example, if the application
is going to be run from the same host as the server, you need to have:
<p/>

<pre><code>host     mydatabase     myuser     127.0.0.1/32    password</code></pre>
<p/>

The application will automatically create the schema on the database you specify
in the connection properties file (see <a href="./configuration.html">Configuration</a> page). 
When you update the application, it will also update the schema on the first launch 
without any data being lost, as well.
