      <p>The business tier is the real working horse in the application.
      This is where all important business decisions are made. No
      business process can take place, unless it's conducted by
      the business tier.</p>

      <p>To ensure that the business tier can meet the demands
      of its clients, the application is using OpenEJB server
      as the container. The OpenEJB manages connections with
      the database and the clients for the business tier as well as takes care
      of security and service availability.</p>
