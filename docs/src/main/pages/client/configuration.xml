      Key2Gym uses Log4J as its logging provider. The logging configuration
      file is located in <code>etc/logging.properties</code> and is a Log4J 
      logging properties file. You can find the documentation on this file 
      <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html">here</a>.
