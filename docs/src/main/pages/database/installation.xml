      Go to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL website</a> to obtain 
      a distribution of PostgreSQL server. The program has been intensively
      tested with PostgreSQL 9.1, however the later version should work as well. 
      If you are running Linux/Unix/BSD, we suggest you to install the PostgreSQL 
      server from the official repository. 
      See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/index.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, 
      if you need help with installing or configuring the server.
      
      <p/>
      The following is a typical setup of a user and a database:
      
      <pre>postgres=# CREATE USER myuser PASSWORD 'mypassword';<br/>
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase OWNER myuser;<br/>
postgres=# \c mydatabase<br/>
postgres=# ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO myuser;
      </pre>

      Note that you also need to modify <code>pg_hba.conf</code> to accept 
      TCP/IP connections from the hosts, where the business tier is going to be run. 
      For example, if the business tier is going to be located on the same host 
      as the database server, you need to have the following configuration file:
      <pre>host     mydatabase     myuser     127.0.0.1/32    password</pre>
