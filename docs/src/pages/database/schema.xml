      The database has got to have an appropriate schema for the business tier
      to work with it. The schema defines the format of the data to be kept and
      processed within the database. In the Key2Gym application the schema management
      is done using Flyway migration tool shipped with the application.
      
      The schema is a subject to change from one version of the application to 
      another. Therefore, the release notes migth tell you to migrate the schema 
      after you updated the business tier.
    </div>
    <div class="well well-large">
      <b>IMPORTANT:</b> You should not run the business tier with an old schema, 
      because it might result in data loss or inconsistency.
    </div>
    <div class="well well-large">
      The schema migration tool is located under the <code>migration</code>
      folder. The rest of this page will describe the usage of the schema migration
      tool.
    </div>
    
    <div class="well well-large">
      Before launching the schema migration tool you need to configure it.
      
      The configuration file is <code>conf/flyway.properties</code>. It's
      well-documented, therefore it should be easy to figure it out.
      
      You need to specify the driver, the url, the username, the password and 
      the database.
    </div>
    
    <div class="well well-large">
      Once the tool is configured, you can run it as following:
      <code>./flyway.sh -target=1 migrate</code>
      This command will migrate the schema to version 1.
