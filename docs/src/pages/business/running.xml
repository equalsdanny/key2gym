<div class="well well-large">Running the OpenEJB server is easy, however, note that the database server
  should already be running upon the OpenEJB starup.
  Go to <code>bin/</code> and issue the following command:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux: <code>./openejb start</code> to start and <code>./openejb stop</code> to stop.</li>
    <li>Windows: <code>Start.bat</code> to start and <code>Stop.bat</code> to stop. See
      readme files for information on support of Windows Services.</li>
