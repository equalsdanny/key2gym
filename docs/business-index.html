<h1>3. Business</h1>
<section>
The business tier is the real working horse in the application.
This is where all important business decisions are made. No
business process can take place, unless it's conducte by
the business tier.

To ensure that the business tier can meet the demands
of its clients, the application is using OpenEJB server
as the container. The OpenEJB manages connections with
the database and the clients for the business tier.
